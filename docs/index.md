Conda auth is a conda plugin which adds more secure authentication support to conda.

Once installed, it provides two new commands you can use to authenticate against
protected, private conda channels:

- `conda auth login` for logging into and storing your credentials
- `conda auth logout` for logging out of and remove your credentials

## Usage

**Log in** to a channel protected by HTTP basic authentication:

```
conda auth login https://example.com/my-protected-channel --username $USERNAME
```

**Log out** of a channel to remove credentials from your computer:

```
conda auth logout https://example.com/my-protected-channel
```

## Installation

To start using conda auth, we recommend installing to your base environment:

```
conda install --name base --channel conda-forge conda-auth
```
